# Daily-Health-Reminder Web App

A simple app I built to help keep track of health-related tasks and reminders.

## What it does

- Keeps track of medication, exercise, water, and other health reminders
- Sends notifications when it's time for a reminder
- Has a dark mode option
- Stores all data locally so it works offline
- Categories for different types of reminders

## How I built it

I used:
- Vue.js
- TailwindCSS for styling
- IndexedDB for storing reminders
- Browser notifications

## Setup

If you want to run this yourself:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start development server
4. Run `npm run build` to build for production

## Features I'm proud of

- The notification system that can send reminders ahead of time
- Category filtering in the notification center
- The clean UI with dark mode support
- How everything is saved locally
